# CSC 365 Proposal
### With Alex Truong, Aaron Krimer, Kyle Lin, and Colin Hassett
Building a class review API to give students a platform to leave feedback on courses and professors at Cal Poly. Users will be able to post reviews, and rate professors and classes.
This API will help students make more informed decisions when planning their schedules. Professors and courses will be stored relationally to allow aggregate ratings and insights.
The database will serve as the record system for reviews, user activity, and course data. The API will support full CRUD operations for users and reviews.
Additionally, the API will be public so anyone can integrate into other tools or front-end apps.
